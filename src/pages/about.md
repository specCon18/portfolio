# Who am I?
I am a 23 year old software engineer. I have a passion for technology that is driven by its capability to solve humanities issue and reduce the struggles of our society as a whole.

# What do I do?
I am like a platapus I don't do very much. All jokes aside I primarly sit around and ponder problems looking to create solutions, when i'm not doing that i'm working in my home lab to better understand new and cutting edge tools and keep myself sharp or flying planes in Digital Combat Simulator.

# Where am I from and why spend time doing this and not somthing else?
I grew up in and around Flint, Michigan most of my life. Seeing the poverty and struggle that I saw growing up drove me to want to help those that I cared about out of the cycle. As I grew older my physical disablilites got worse and I saw a need for STEM education in the area as the space is growing and it the education could enable to help bring back some social wealth to the city. I currently live in Grand Blanc and now I am working to be able to provide that education through an open and free online resource.
