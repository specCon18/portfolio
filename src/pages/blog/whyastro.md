I recently returned to the workforce after dealing with some medical complications. During my time away, many new technologies arose to disrupt the web development scene. Every day in the reactive web application space, a new framework is released, which means that I had to choose which one I was willing to commit myself to for the next little while.

After plenty of searching, I settled on Svelte. It was fast, I liked the way that its components were written, and most of all, the fact that it didn't use a virtual DOM really appealed to me. This was unique to all the other options at the time I was looking. I was even planning to use Svelte to write this blog post.

Then one morning, as I was getting ready, I received a notification from YouTube for a video from the content creator fireship about this emerging framework called Astro. I was blown away. In that moment, I saw Astro for what it was: a lightweight way to deliver a modern website. Not only does it use its island-based architecture to minimize the JavaScript shipped to the browser, but it can also act truly as the one framework to rule them all. This is because of its ability to render components from any major framework ‚Äì React, Svelte, Vue, Angular ‚Äì it doesn't matter. Whatever framework you're coming from, Astro can be a tool for you to build faster websites.

This meant that I could still use what I had learned about Svelte for all of my reactive web components, but could also deliver features from component-specific libraries when needed. You can have your framework and efficiency too!

I was sold! My only question was how to get started. I went to the Astro website and was greeted by a beautiful site with extremely well-written documentation. I dug in and got started, and shortly into my time working with Astro, I found out about MDX. I had never heard of MDX before ‚Äì I had written plenty of Markdown, but what was the "X" for? So I did some reading and found out that not only does Astro have support for Markdown, but it can also support writing JavaScript in Markdown.

In conclusion, Astro is a big win. It allows for the use of components from any major framework, including React, Svelte, Vue, and Angular. It's a lightweight and efficient way to build modern websites, and the documentation and website provided by the Astro team are wonderful.
